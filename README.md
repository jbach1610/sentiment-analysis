## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **sentiment analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to  
*My Sweet Orange Tree* by José Mauro de Vasconcelos.

Rather than viewing the novel solely through the lens of child abuse, this analysis explores
how **compassion, love, friendship, and self-compassion** shape the protagonist’s emotional
language. The project demonstrates how **quantitative text analysis** can complement
traditional literary interpretation to uncover deeper emotional patterns.

---

## 🔍 Research Question
> How does the protagonist’s emotional growth and self-compassion influence language
intensity and sentiment throughout the novel?

Specifically, I examine whether self-compassion mitigates **negativity bias**, even in the
presence of physical and psychological abuse.

## 🧠 Methodology
This project combines **qualitative close reading** with **quantitative NLP techniques**:

### Quantitative Tools
- **Voyant Tools** for word frequency, dispersion, and trend visualization
- **Lexicon-based sentiment analysis** using:
  - Bing (binary positive/negative)
  - AFINN (valence intensity scoring)
  - NRC (emotion categories such as trust, sadness, joy)

### Qualitative Frameworks
- Negativity Bias (Cognitive Psychology)
- Self-Compassion Theory (Kristin Neff)
- Attachment Theory (Bowlby)

Selected segments were analyzed across **secure vs. insecure attachment relationships**
(e.g., family members vs. nurturing figures) to compare emotional language patterns.

---

## 📊 Key Findings
- Positive and trust-oriented language appears **more frequently than expected**, despite
the novel’s traumatic context.
- The protagonist consistently uses **low-intensity negative words**, suggesting emotional
regulation rather than suppression.
- Language associated with **trust and compassion** often outweighs sadness, even in
interactions with abusive figures.
- The absence of extreme negative terms (e.g., “hate”) highlights the role of
**self-compassion in mitigating negativity bias**.

These findings challenge surface-level interpretations of the novel and reveal its broader
emotional complexity.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Lexicon-based sentiment analysis lacks contextual awareness.
- Overlapping character mentions complicate segmentation.
- Analysis was conducted on the **English translation**, which may affect sentiment
valence compared to the original Portuguese or Vietnamese versions.
